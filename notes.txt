the bacterium should have the following variables:

enzyme
efflux
membrane
repair
speed
type
position (already present pos)
max age/ max timestamp
instead of resistance these are the formulas for survivability:

A_eff = Antibiotic_concentration × ( 1 − efflux_weight ⋅ efflux ) × ( 1 − enzyme_weight ⋅ enzyme ) × ( 1 − membrane_weight ⋅ membrane )

survival probability = e^( − Antibiotic_toxicity_constant , A eff , ( 1 − repair_weight ⋅ repair ) )

the system should enable different types of antibiotcs each should have its own enzyme_weight, membrane_weight, efflux_weight, Antibiotic_toxicity_constant, repair_weight

a subset of X antibiotics and Y bacterial type should either be generated at start up or, if provided, should be loaded from a file.
Bacterial type should provide some ranges for :

enzyme
efflux
membrane
repair
max age/ max timestamp
so for example bacterial type A should be:
enzyme = 0.4+-0.1
efflux = 0.3+-0.2 etc

When generating the first generation the process should spawn a number Z of bacterial for each type

the bacteria should die of old age, starvation or from the antibiotics, for these try to revaualate the energy system or change it completly, lets discuss it
